  \section{Course Overview}
    This is an applied introductory machine learning course covering the basics of machine learning algorithms and data analysis.
    Topics covered include:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Regression analysis
      \item Probabilistic modeling
      \item Support vector machines
      \item Supervised vs unsupervised learning
      \item Reinforcement learning
      \item Neural networks
    \end{itemize}

  \section{Introduction - What is Machine Learning?}
    Machine learning is the field of study of how computers can improve their performance at tasks (i.e. learn) without being explicitly
    programmed to do so. Machine learning can be useful for tasks for which it is difficult to write a step-by-step imperative program.
    Sample applications include optical character recognition, computer vision, and game playing.

    \subsection{Learning Frameworks}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Supervised Learning:} Goal is to learn a function based on its input and output (e.g. determining if an email is spam
          based on a set of emails labeled as spam or not spam).
        \item \textbf{Unsupervised Learning:} Goal is to learn a function based on its input alone (e.g. organizing data into clusters).
        \item \textbf{Reinforcement Learning:} Goal is to learn a sequence of actions that maximize some notion of reward (e.g. learning how
          to control a vehicle to perform some maneuver).
      \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Challenges}
      Some of the challenges facing machine learning today are:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Dealing with large amounts of data (algorithm complexity and distributed computing become very relevant)
        \item Generating reproducible results
        \item Challenges concerning real-world adoption of work (e.g. human computer interaction, robustness, ethical concerns)
      \end{itemize}
